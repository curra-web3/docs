# ðŸ”œ Deploy Operator

Operators are critical to Curra decentralized protocol, they are responsible for executing transactional clearing for Protocol User, triggering on-chain transaction from **Receive Address** and Relaying Withdrawals for Protocol User**.**

Anybody can deploy their own Operator implementing Operator Interface to enhance crypto processing with consumer-oriented features and pricing models.

We anticipate that Fiat Off-ramp services, Compliance Services, Custodians, and other B2B Crypto Solutions will become Operators, contributing and expanding Curra Protocol, with their own monetisation model, to reach new clients, providing additional services along with crypto processing, not bothering with Crypto Processing Back-end.

**Operator Example**: Retail Store that wants to accept crypto and directly settle it to its Bank Account. They can choose Off-ramp Operator and accept crypto with automated settlements, where Operator can cover all Gas Costs, on itâ€™s own.

**Private Operator Example**: A crypto processing company or crypto exchange want to use Curra to reduce gas costs and delegate infrastructure maintenance to on-chain architecture by deploying its own private Operator for internal use.

### Crypto API

Operators have ultimate access to [Curra Crypto API](curra-crypto-api.md) with a variety of integrated processing-oriented features to expand settlement flow and provide advanced processing flow.

### Staking Contract

To deploy an Operator, you must stake CUR tokens to the Staking Contract as proof of solvency. Curra Coordinator monitors Operators for any malicious behavior, and has the ability to reduce the stake of any Operator that engages in inappropriate on-chain conduct, relating to Protocol Users.

Details about the tokenomics related to Operator stakes will be released soon.
