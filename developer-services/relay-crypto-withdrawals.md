# ðŸ”œ Relay Crypto Withdrawals

Curra allows you to pay salaries to your employees or to make withdrawals for end-users with a couple of clicks (API Calls).&#x20;

### Give your withdrawal request, the relayer takes care of the rest! <a href="#h-send-your-meta-transactions-the-relayer-takes-care-of-the-rest" id="h-send-your-meta-transactions-the-relayer-takes-care-of-the-rest"></a>

Using the Curra Withdrawal Relayer, you can initiate gasless withdrawals from your Hot Wallet that will be relayed via Operator. This feature enables Protocol Users to send transactions without needing a native token balance, paying fees in the currency of their choice.&#x20;

With the delegation of transaction nonces and fee estimation to the Operator, you don't need to worry about those details anymore.
