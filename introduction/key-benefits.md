# Key Benefits

With Curra, our mission is to revolutionise blockchain and Web3 technology just as Visa revolutionised the internet.

Merchants and Custodians now can use Curra Protocol to integrate crypto payments into their operations, and move away from Custodial Processing Services.

* Simple: Curra Protocol automates most of the processing flow, making it easy to use.&#x20;
* Secure: Assets are secured on-chain by forwarding rules, ensuring that they are protected.&#x20;
* Fail-tolerant: On-chain architecture provides the most reliable uptime, as the blockchain can serve.&#x20;
* No single point of failure: Multiple Operators are located all over the world, reducing the risk of any single point of failure.&#x20;
* Multi-chain: protocol works with the most popular EVM-compatible and even non-EVM networks.&#x20;
* Cost-effective: Curra is cheaper than building, running, and maintaining custom architecture or using other processing solutions. And we are still working on making contracts cheaper.
* Flexible payment options: The payment options available depend on the features of the Operators, making it easy to choose the best option for your needs.&#x20;
