## General

As mentioned in the [introduction](what_is_curra.md), Curra doesn't charge any processing fees, which means that you pay only for blockchain network fees. All funds that are received to [receive addresses](../features/receive_addresses.md) have to be forwarded to your wallet, in order to make it possible you have to fill your balance with coins which will be used to pay for these transactions. Balance can be filled using Curra <a href="https://app.curra.io/" target="_blank">application</a>.

## How to make it cheaper

### Enable bundles

In order to reduce your expenses x2-3 times you can enable bundles on <a href="https://app.curra.io/configuration" target="_blank">configuration page</a>. After bundles enabled Curra coordinator will wait until configured amount of incomes confirmed on your receive addresses and only after that those will be forwarded within single transaction, which reduces fees significantly. Recommended bundle size is â€“ 15

### Reuse addresses

First deposit to receive address is ~3 times more expensive then second and further incomes to the address
