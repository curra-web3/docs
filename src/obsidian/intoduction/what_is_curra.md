# What is Curra?

## Introduction

Curra is a pioneer to process crypto payments in a trustless and decentralized manner. On-chain protocol architecture, eliminates the need for costly and complex custodial solutions, providing merchants and custodians a variety of features to accept crypto without centralized intermediaries.

## Security

Curra leverages an on-chain protocol to replace the centralized nature of crypto processing. Through smart contracts within the protocol, we guarantee that all funds belong solely to you. At every stage of the processing, you maintain full ownership of your client's funds, with no intermediaries involved. All assets are securely directed straight to your wallet.

## Low costs

At present, the majority of cryptocurrency processing providers are costly, charging significantly higher fees than their actual expenses. However, Curra offers a different approach. With Curra, you only pay for the blockchain transaction fees, regardless of the transaction amount. Moreover, Curra utilizes advanced smart contracts that are highly optimized for gas consumption and incorporates various cost-saving methods available in the field. We are continuously working on further optimization and innovation in this area.
